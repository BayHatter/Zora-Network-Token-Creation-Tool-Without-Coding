# Usage Terms for Polygon Token Creation Tool

This project allows developers to build custom ERC-20 tokens on the Polygon network using the official API included in the code.

## You May:
- View and use the source code to build your own frontend or token UI
- Modify the interface or UI logic
- Integrate this into your own site, **as long as the backend still uses the official API**

## You May Not:
- Remove or replace the API endpoint used for token creation
- Redistribute or fork the code with a custom backend for token deployment
